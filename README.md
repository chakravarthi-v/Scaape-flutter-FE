<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>Humans are social beings, hence socializing and meeting new people is an impulsive part of our nature, but due to this recent pandemic which has kept us stuck in our houses for more than a year now, we are impotent to carry out this natural habit of ours. Now, As humans we tend to feel abandoned quite easily, it's like a trait of us like while going out for a walk, touring a new city, or even going to the gym, we seek for the company to keep our boredom away, but we can’t always be surrounded by people who are ready to accompany us wherever we wanna go, hence we propose the concept of an application called <b>Scaape</b> which help us to find a company who appreciate the same interests as we do. So, Let’s <i>escape</i> with <i>Scaape</i>.
</p>

<h1>About</h2>
<p> With Scaape we intend to help you meet new people around your place, with the same interest and hobbies as you,  who may accompany you in your daily walks, gym, or tour to a new city or landmark. With Scaape you can create an event or as we like to call it <b>‘Scaape’</b>and people around your place can join the event to give you company. You can create a Scaape for whatever you like from going out to try out a new hangout location to just wanting to have a walk with some people, no matter how silly it is if it’s something related to meeting people, we got you covered.
