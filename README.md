<h1>About</h1>
<p>Humans are social beings, hence socializing and meeting new people is an impulsive part of our nature, but due to this pandemic which has kept us stuck in our houses for a year now, we are impotent to carry out this natural habit of ours. Now, As humans we tend to feel abandoned quite easily, it's like a trait of us like while going out for a walk, touring a new city, or even going to the gym, we seek for the company to keep our boredom away, but we can’t always be surrounded by people who are ready to accompany us wherever we wanna go, hence we propose the concept of an application called <b>Scaape</b> which help us to find a company who appreciate the same interests as we do. So, Let’s <i>escape</i> with <i>Scaape</i>.
